Guess the Legends
Scan the QR code printed next to each puzzle to reveal that puzzle’s answer here.

How it works
Scan a QR code in the book. You’ll be asked once for your name & email.
After that, every scan shows the answer immediately (on the same device/browser).
Each QR shows only its own answer—no spoilers for other puzzles.
Tip: For testing, try Puzzle 01.

Having trouble? Make sure you scanned from the book or added ?id=01–40 to the URL.
